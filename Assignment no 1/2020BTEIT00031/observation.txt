Observation:

Sequence of functions executed from gprof:
Yes, we can decide sequence of functions executed from gprof.
Following is sequence of functions from gprof:
1)partition(int*, int, int)
2)swap(int*, int*)
3)printArray(int*, int)
4)quickSort(int*, int, int)

Firstly, by entering different commands we will get profile output for different n values and from that we can observe following things:

1)Here by putting different values of n we can see different time complexities.
2)By putting n=10, we can see time complexity is approximately 0. Likewise for n=100 and n=1000 also.
3)But when we increase value of n we can see increase in time complexity. That is for bigger values like n=10000 and n=100000 we got time complexity for different functions.This we can see in output file.
4)We can obeserve here as we increase n values time complexity increases. 

5)Time and space complexity:
Here the time complexity of program is O(n*log(n).
The space complexity of program is O(n*log(n)).

6)Conclusion:
Complexity of Quicksort algorithm is O(n*log (n)).
